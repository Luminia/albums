## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing
purposes.

### Prerequisites

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't
have any installed on your system.

* npm is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js,
you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

or

* Yarn is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general.  [Download Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
